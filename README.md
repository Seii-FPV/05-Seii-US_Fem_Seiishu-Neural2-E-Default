# Known issues:

- Going into the "ACCESSIBILITY" menu (Press and hold EXIT-F button for 3 seconds to enter the "ACCESSIBILITY" menu), followed by going into the "POWER" submenu, and picking the "OUTPUT VOLTAGE"... whatever value is picked, voice will read out only the value afer the decimal point. So for example, if we pick 25.2V, charger will read only "point 2 Volts"... if we pick 27.9V, charger will read only "point 9 Volts". It has nothing to do with my voice files, every single possible file I made is correct, but the problem is in ToolkitRC M7/AC and M9 software/firmware. Only ToolkitRC can fix this, and until then, we will have to live with this issue. Maybe if more of us report this problem to ToolkitRC developers, they will do something about it.
